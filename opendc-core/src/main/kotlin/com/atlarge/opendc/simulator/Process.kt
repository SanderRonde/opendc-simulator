     * simulation.
     * Suspending the process can be achieved by calling suspending method in the context:
     * 	- [Context.hold]	- Hold for `n` units of time before resuming execution.
     * 	- [Context.receive]	- Wait for a message to be received in the mailbox of the [Entity] before resuming
     * 	execution.

     * If this method exits early, before the simulation has finished, the entity is assumed to be shutdown and its
     * simulation will not run any further.
